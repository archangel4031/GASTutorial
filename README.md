This is the source code for the Tutorial Series [UE4 Gameplay Ability System for Blueprint Programemrs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeEXbS_TaXrDlqQv753CpKqDlpNXixFMg).

The code will be updates as the we progress in the series.

**NOTE:** This only contains the "Source" folder from the project. You should only copy portion of the code that you require for your own project as the code contains some lines that are specific to this Tutorial Project (the Project Name "GASTutorial" Macro, for example).
